# Minehut Tracker
First we did it in a Discord Bot (GalaxyDev), then we did it in a [website](https://galaxynetwork.ml/minehut_tracker/), and now we did it in Java so you can view minehut servers in a minehut server?!?!? That's super cool like imagine viewing details of your own minehut server and you checked it in your own server that's awesome!!
